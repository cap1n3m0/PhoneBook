This is a phone book I made using Python. After entering a username and password, you can proceed to the My Contacts page where you view, add, and remove contacts.
A master file is created (unaccessible and invisible to the user) which stores the username and password of each account. Then, for each account, a text file is 
created which stores the contacts so that even after the application is closed, the program retains the contacts and the user can view them when he or she logs in.
